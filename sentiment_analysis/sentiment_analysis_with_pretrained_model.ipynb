    "# Sentiment Analysis by Fine-tuning Word Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered some advanced topics, let's go back and show how these techniques can help us even when addressing the comparatively simple problem of classification. In particular, we'll look at the classic problem of sentiment analysis: taking an input consisting of a string of text and classifying its sentiment as positive of negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to use GluonNLP to build a sentiment analysis model whose weights are initialized based on a pretrained language model. Using pretrained language model weights is a common approach for semi-supervised learning in NLP. In order to do a good job with large language modeling on a large corpus of text, our model must learn representations that contain information about the structure of natural language. Intuitively, by starting with these good features, vs random features, we're able to converge faster upon a good model for our downsteam task.\n",
    "\n",
    "With GluonNLP, we can quickly prototype the model and it's easy to customize. The building process consists of just three simple steps. For this demonstration we'll focus on movie reviews from the Large Movie Review Dataset, also known as the IMDB dataset. Given a movie, our model will output prediction of its sentiment, which can be positive or negative.\n",
